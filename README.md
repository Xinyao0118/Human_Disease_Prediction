# Introduction

__*Scenario*__

The data is from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
that contains information on various outbreaks of animal diseases.
It has 17008 rows and 24 columns.In addition, the data shows when, where
and what of animal disease outbreaks from the last 2 years, including African
swine fever, Foot and mouth disease and bird-
u,numbers of cases, deaths or etc
are also included.
The outcome is whether human gets sick or not.

__*Objectives*__

The goal is to develop classification model to predict which outbreaks of animal diseases will lead to humans getting sick. Another goal is to compare the performance of two dierent types


__*Tuning parameter selection*__

In the Original data, Positive cases only takes 0.08331373. Thus, the odds of
positive versus negative cases was seemed as the previous model information
and added into the next model as tuning parameter.

__*Gradient boosting*__

Xgboost is a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system developed by Tianqi Xu.
It is based on a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted
quantile sketch for approximate tree learning.[1]

__*Train models using Xgboost to predict the outcome*__

The input data were revised to exclude redundant information and outcome.
The outcome were changed to a binary form. In addition, categorical variables
were transformed to sparse matrix. All of variables in training set were numeric
before training the model. The Xgboost system will select the most signicant
variables and the test error for the model picked by Xgboost.

__*Compare the performance of two different types of splitting data*__

Since the outcome is binary, performance of each model is measured by mis-classification rate. 

##2 Information flow process

__*Assumptions1*__

Data over a threshold value can be seemed representative.
This assumption is to limit the situation when empirical data is small so splitting to multiple sets is not appropriate.

__*Assumptions2*__

Classification information of large data is more closed to truth.
This assumption is to give support to apply the predicted classication outcome from the larger previous training data as the tuning parameter to train the next model.

__*Design of information flow process*__

Building a series of models instead of only one.
Each model using the previous information for tuning. In this case the odds
of positive versus negative cases were used as additional information.
If the data is small, a inside bootstrap process is recommended.

__*Gradient Tree Boosting*__
